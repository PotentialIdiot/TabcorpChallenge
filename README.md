# iOS Assignment

## General Info
An iOS app that displays data from spacex API
This project was initially developed using MVC, which was then converted to MVVM and RxSwift for the bonus points

MVVM is used to decouple the data formatting from the controllers and bind observables via RxSwift

## Assumptions
* Used static table view, iboutlets and storyboards for rapid development
* Limited server requests to 10 launches only
* Display a chosen few data points for launch and rocket as the detailed launch information screen instead of all the data in the endpoint

## Libraries
* RxSwift
